I was going to make some mango milkshake tonight but as I was cutting up closer to the center, I realized that there were dead bugs inside. Unfortunately, I was cutting up the pieces of mangoes directly into the blender with the milk so I had to start all over. I haven't written much these past two months, even on my typewriter. Nevermind, I just remembered that I wrote a lot on my notepad so I guess it cancels out. I ended up getting some mango ice cream out from the freezer and using that to make my mango milkshake. The milk used for that is going to expire a day after my birthday. When I was small, my mother didn't have any games on her phone so all I would do was scroll through the calendar imagining what my life would be like through the years. Looking back, I am sure that the younger me would be surprised with where I am. I often ask this question to my friends. Would their younger version recognize them? I also had some mango yogurt before the milkshake coincidentally. I was writing on my notepad while on a flight back home with friends. I also finally tested my film camera during that trip to find out that my cheap Pentax MX was not a scam (though I do need to get better at focusing my subject properly : ( ). I am always fearful that my eyesight is getting worse though the last time I went to optimetrist for it, they said it was all in my head hehe.
