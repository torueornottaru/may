I used to look out of the window of my classroom of first grade whenever I was bored. It was either this or try to hear sounds from the table when keeping my head down. However the class used to be really loud half of the time so the only way to get a sense of peace was by looking out. Tall trees swaying in the distance and a severe lack of clouds due to summer. In just a few months, the playground below would get flooded because of poor drainage. There used to be older kids playing over there most of the time since they could bully anyone else who tried to take 'their' space. At least, that's what I thought they would do, I never talked to any of them. 
When I was bored with nothing to do at home, I'd open my mother's phone and play with its calendar and calculator (father's phone was off limits due to office work). It was fun to sift through the months and realize how old I will be at those times. It feels funny believing that once upon a time, just being a 10th grader felt the same as being an old man. I used to look at those kids wondering if I will be like them as they chased after a ball while covered in sweat. Would I find myself just as scary when that happens, would others?
What is interesting to note is that people a few years older than still hold that same sense of a mystery. I can't see my future until it becomes the present but at least back then, I had a bigger sense of an imagination as I tried to imagine what my life would be like as I became a teenager, an adult and finally having the ability to drink. Unfortunately the furthest I had ever looked in that calendar was till the year of 2024 (it is a special year for me after all).

I stopped receiving gifts on my birthdays some time back. I wonder if I ever imagined that happening as I looked at the calendar. I think I should go to sleep
