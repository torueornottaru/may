It is quite late at night as I write this. I think the best way to fix my insomnia is by not thinking about it so I am going to experiment with that now onwards until I find something new. I'm also writing this for the second time since I deleted it by accident previously.

I have always been somewhat strict with the absence of personal information in my writing. Partially because I do not know who reads what where but mostly because I believe that the blank slate in my writing makes anyone who reads it believe that it is in fact about them, that it is their own thought or that they are the main character in my words, a fill in the blanks which makes the rigidity of visualization disappear. Which is why I had to think a lot before mentioning the existence of Bombay in my life. I hope you understand what I mean by this as you read further but the gist of it would be that I couldn't imagine a blank city in Bombay's place as it just couldn't fit in and made everything too frustrating. Eh, it seems that the new sleep strategy might be working and I really do not wish to write all this a third time. I will write more in the morning.
