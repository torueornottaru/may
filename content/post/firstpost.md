I am supposed to make a video that I was supposed to make a month back but instead I will do it in one hour. A very rare procrastination moment from me. One of my classes got canceled and the other class is teaching very basic stuff that I already know but since I am here, might as well attend it instead of making the video. I am pretty sure writing this instead of paying attention in class doesn't constitute as attending but the room is very poorly ventilated and it is also really hot so I really can not focus. Someone was in my washroom when I woke up so instead of having a bath in another washroom, I spent 20 minutes waiting for the other person to get out. 
Since I have disposable income and independence now, I am finally investing in my interests. I got a really cheap record player for helping someone out and have bought some really cheap classical pieces on vinyls that I really like. I play those while writing on my Olivetti 32 cursive typewriter or playing games on my CRT TV with my PS2 or DS both of which I have hacked. (Apart from the typewriter, I haven't spent a lot of money for my other interests for which I am really happy but the space that they occupy in my room is also concerning). I think I might be a hoarder but if it makes me happy and I am keeping everything neat and tidy, so be it. Even this website is another interest. The newest one however is this completely analog (doesn't require a battery for anything including the shutter closing except for the exposure meter but that is something that I rarely plan on using).
The camera is a Pentax MX which is considered the best of the best because of it usually sells at a really high cost but someone who didn't understand its value sold it for a very low price and I bought it. It will be coming home soon and I will upload a picture of it when it comes.
Okay that is it for now, I will talk more later, bibi.
