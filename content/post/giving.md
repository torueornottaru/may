If I died yesterday, would I be happy? I feel like this question is inherently wrong because of its subjective nature and also because I asked the question incorrectly. If I died today, would I be content? This is the correct question. Being content is a lot more objective than being happy. But is being content even correct? If I am content, would I ever grow? I don't think so. Is it sad to not be content. Possibly. Oh well. American houses always look so hollow. I am in a car seeing them pass by. Most f the trees have lost color but the water hasn't started freezing yet. Leaves are slowly turning into mulch on the ground. I always thought that I'd like to go into wooded mountains once I was grown up enough to do so but now that I am, I have the excuse of never having time. I like going into woods because I like to feel a bigger connection to whatever's out there. I don't know. I can already see christmas decorations in some houses. Yesterday I was walking and the roads had started to get slippery because of icing and no salt. I saw a dish for cable TV. Havn't seen one in some time now. I wonder if all of these partially abandoned towns that got less preferred over american suburbia will eventually become something else. I always find these places really scary. There are still some shops that are open in these places which makes me believe that people are actively living full lives in these places. I heard somepeople raving about a new chick fil-a that opened up near to my place and I found it hilarious but also significant. The biggest highway that I have ever driven on is 8 laned. But I have always found that highway to be mostly empty. I wonder if the 8 lanes actuall solved a trffic problem or are just useless. I guess you'll never know. Government offices are always so understaffed, I was on hold for close to 1 hour for a thing that required about 5 minutes of work. Enough writing for today. I won't say I am content but I am excited for what's to come. That's the only thing I can do.
