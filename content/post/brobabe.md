Writing this in class today, I am sort of busy nowadays or at least I feel like I am pretending to be busy. I need to get back my stuff together however. Yesterday I had to edit a video but my computer basically started burning and then my render didn't translate well into export and that was really annoying. Ended up using another machine and it took just ten minutes to render and export the video so that was nice. The people for whom I was making it liked it. Yesterday was the hottest day of the week but then there were thunderstorms in the night. No rain but the wind was so strong that I felt like I would have literally blown : )). I am sticking to general schedule quite well, waking up and sleeping at correct time, eating food correctly, yada yada but everything else is getting out of hand or at least I feel like that so over the weekend I will try to fix that. 
No other updates right now, will come back later. bibi.
Back, today feels boring because of chores but eh, they're going to get over soon. My project got delayed but for the better but I also don't wish to feel like that happened because I didn't put myself fully in that. Looking at this GIF makes me happy.

I have more time to make this work but I really hope I don't slip out more because of this and hopefully use this delay as a breather and get my stuff together. I will stick to the same deadlines as I did before. WAAAAAAA, I chose this title before I felt like typing WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA but now I feel that way. I need to calm myself down and think this through. I will ask other people whether delaying the projects affects them negatively by any chance. I also have to get my head out of this a bit. Because I don't know why this is affecting me so negatively when it is actually a positive. If anything, the delay works so much better timing wise. I am typing my keys too hard. This isn't nice. I will stop now. Okay, that is it. proper bibi.

Got stuck in rain, yippee. Waiting for it to let down but if it doesn't then I guess I am having a bath. I feel like I manifested this by making the title of this WAAAAAA.
